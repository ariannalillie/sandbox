# Long Practice: Class Syntax with Employees and Managers

In this practice, you will create and use classes, inheritance, polymorphism,
and commonJS module importing/exporting!

## Learning Goals

* Understand how a child class inherits from a parent class
* Know how to override a parent class's method
* Know when and how to use `super` and `extends`

## Set up

Clone the starter from the **Download** link at the bottom of this page.

## Phase 1: Define Employee and Manager classes

In the starter project directory, set up two files, __employee.js__ and
__manager.js__, for two classes, `Employee` and `Manager`.

In the __employee.js__ file, define an `Employee` class with a constructor that
sets an `Employee`'s `name`, `title`, `salary`, and `boss`. 

In the __manager.js__ file, define another class, `Manager`, as a child class of
the `Employee` class. `Manager` should have an attribute that holds an array of
all `Employee`s assigned to the `Manager`.

> **Note**: A `Manager` may be under another `Manager` because `Manager`s might
> report to higher-level `Manager`s.

> Reminder: Use CommonJS modules to get the `Employee` class into the
> __manager.js__ file.

Define a method, `bonus(multiplier)` in the `Employee` class. `Employee`s who
are not a `Manager` should calculate their bonus like this:

```plaintext
bonus = (employee salary) * multiplier
```

A `Manager` should calculate their bonus based on the total salary of all of
their `Employee`s, as well as the `Manager`'s `Employee`s' `Employee`s, and the
`Employee`s' `Employee`s' `Employee`s, etc. `Manager` employees should calculate
their bonus like this:

```plaintext
bonus = (total salary of all employees under them) * multiplier
```

<details><summary>Hint: </summary>You can extract the logic of calculating the
total salary of all a <code>Manager</code>'s <code>Employee</code>s into a
helper method which iterates through each of a <code>Manager</code>'s
<code>Employee</code>s, checking if the <code>Employee</code> is an instance of
a <code>Manager</code> or not. If the <code>Employee</code> is a
<code>Manager</code>, and add the sum of their <code>Employee</code>s' salaries
to the total salary. If the <code>Employee</code> is not a <code>Manager</code>,
add the <code>Employee</code>'s salary to the total salary.</details>

## Phase 2: Testing

Imagine you have a company structured like this:

| Name     | Salary  | Title      | Boss   |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Hobbes   | 1000000 | Founder    | null   |
| Calvin   | 130000  | Director   | Hobbes |
| Susie    | 100000  | TA Manager | Calvin |
| Lily     | 90000   | TA         | Susie  |
| Clifford | 90000   | TA         | Susie  |

If Hobbes gets a bonus multiplier of 0.05, their bonus will be $70,500.

If Calvin gets a bonus multiplier of 0.05, their bonus will be $20,500.

If Susie gets a bonus multiplier of 0.05, their bonus will be $14,000.

If Lily gets a bonus multiplier of 0.05, their bonus will be $4,500.

If Clifford gets a bonus multiplier of 0.05, their bonus will be $4,500.

Create a new file called __test.js__. Create the scenario above and make sure
you get the correct bonuses for each employee.
