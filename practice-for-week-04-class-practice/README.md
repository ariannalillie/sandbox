# JavaScript Class Practice

In this exercise, you will be creating a class by creating a constructor and
defining static and instance methods.

## Set up

Clone the project from the [starter]. Run `npm install`

You will implement all your code in **class-practice.js**.

## Phases

1. Basic Class Syntax - create a class with a constructor, static, and instance
   methods
2. Inheritance - implementing two classes which demonstrate class inheritance
3. Polymorphism - overwrite inherited instance methods in child classes
