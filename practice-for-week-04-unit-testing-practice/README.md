# Unit Testing Practice

## Directions

Clone the practice from the [starter].

Run `npm install` to download dependencies.

1. In the file **funcs.js**, you will find three skeleton functions. Your job is
   to complete those functions according to the specs found in
   **test/funcs-spec.js**.
2. In the file **class.js**, you will find a class `Word`. Your job is to write
   the test code in **test/class-spec.js** to test the constructor, its
   variables, and the instance methods found in the `Word` class.

Run `npm test` to confirm your code is written correctly.
